Parliament, Monday, 15 March 2021 – The Ad Hoc Committee on section 100 Intervention in the North West Province will this evening, on a virtual platform, interact with the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) on progress in cases referred to it as part of the Section 100 intervention in the province.
	
	The committee is in the North West Province this week to review the work of the Inter-Ministerial Task Team (IMTT) and the impact of the intervention in the province. The engagement with the NPA is a follow-up on an engagement the committee had with this prosecuting body where the committee raised concerns about limited information as well as slow pace of prosecutions against those found guilty.
	
	The committee then took a decision to reconvene the meeting with the NPA.
	“While we remain cognisant that investigation must be meticulous and sometimes lengthy in efforts to ensure watertight legal processes, we remain concerned that some cases have dragged since 2018 with no set time frame for conclusion of the investigation,” said Mr China Dodovu, the Chairperson of the committee.
	
	The committee will get an update since the previous meeting together with the information that the committee requested.
	
	Details of the interaction with NPA:
	Date: Monday, 15 March 2021
	Time: 17:00
	Venue: Virtual Platform
	
	ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE AD HOC COMMITTEE ON SECTION 100 INTERVENTION IN THE NORTH WEST PROVINCE, MR CHINA DODOVU.
