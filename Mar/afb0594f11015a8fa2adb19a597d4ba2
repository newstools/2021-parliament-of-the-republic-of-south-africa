Parliament, Friday, 12 March 2021 – The Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Sports, Arts and Culture, Ms Beauty Dlulane, has congratulated Dr Patrice Motsepe for being elected unopposed as President of the Confederation of African Football (CAF).
	
	Dr Motsepe was elected unopposed today as the new CAF President in Morocco. The committee has always maintained its unwavering support for Dr Motsepe’s candidacy.
	
	Ms Dlulane said the work to make African football competitive starts now. The committee believes that competent and efficient administration had been assembled, and as team captain, Dr Motsepe needs to ensure administration of football across countries is improved, and that CAF becomes an influential player at the global sphere of decision-making.
	
	“The country should be proud for this achievement, a first South African elected into the position. Dr Motsepe’s presidency should benefit not only the region, but the continent on all facets of football including financials, player welfare, solid amateur structures and competitions.”
