Parliament, Friday, 5 March 2021 – The Portfolio Committee on Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) on Tuesday interacted with the Dr Ruth Segomotsi Mompati District Municipality and all the municipalities under it on the state of the district municipality and its municipalities.
	
	Paragraphs 3 and 4 are amended as follows:
	
	The committee was informed of a citizen’s group at Mamusa Local Municipality which had called for the removal of the municipal manager based on allegations of his appointment being irregular. It was reported that in November 2020 the municipality commissioned a legal opinion, which found that the municipal manager did not have the required qualifications.
	
	The acting municipal manager of Kagisano – Molopo Local Municipality, told the committee that he will qualify in July this year. The committeee requested the respective mayors and the provincial MEC of CoGHSTA, Mr Mmoloki Cwaile, to provide a written response to the committee on these two appointments.
	
	The previous statement erroneously referred to the municipal manager of Mamusa Local Municipality as having “briefed” the committee. The committee regrets this error.
	
	ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON COOPERATIVE GOVERNANCE AND TRADITIONAL AFFAIRS, MS FAITH MUTHAMBI.
