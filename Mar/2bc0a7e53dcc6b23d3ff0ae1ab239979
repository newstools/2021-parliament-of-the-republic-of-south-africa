Parliament, Tuesday, 16 March 2021 – The Portfolio Committee on Home Affairs, and the Select Committee on Security and Justice held a workshop today on electoral reform as part of the consultation process of amending the Electoral Act to allow individuals to stand for election to Parliament and provincial legislatures. The Constitutional Court ruled in July last year that the Electoral Act is unconstitutional because it does not allow individual candidates to run for political office, and gave Parliament 24 months in which to amend the legislation. Today the committee received inputs from the Minister of Home Affairs, the Electoral Commission, the Advisory Committee on Electoral Amendments, My Vote Counts, and the Electoral Institute for Sustainable Democracy in Africa. The Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Home Affairs, Adv Bongani Bongo, said the workshop will continue and more stakeholders will be invited to make submissions on the electoral reform process. Among the bodies expected to make submissions in the next workshop are Statistics South Africa and the Municipal Demarcation Board. “The process of changing the electoral system must involve the electorate. In responding to the court judgement we must consider the electorate, they want to have a say on how they want to vote. At the end of the process we must deliver an electoral system that is very durable and in the interest of our future generations,” said Adv Bongo.
