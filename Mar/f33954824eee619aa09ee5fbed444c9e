Parliament, Tuesday, 30 March 2021 – The Portfolio Committee on Sports, Arts and Culture has noted the signing off of SABC news veteran broadcaster, Ms Noxolo Grootboom.
	
	The Chairperson of the committee, Ms Beauty Dlulane, said the role Ms Grootboom played in inspiring South Africans of all ages to be proud of who they are and their languages, can never be underestimated.
	
	Ms Dlulane said: “Noxolo was not just a news reader but an activist of a different kind. One ought to see the massive following of her signature ‘Ndinithanda nonk’ emakhaya’, which came to define an era of television news not only among isiXhosa speakers, but to all South Africans across affiliations.
	
	“The rest is deserved and that we should be proud that there are followers to take up the baton. It is sad to see her perform one last gig, but the impact she’s had over the years should inspire us all.”
	
	Ms Grootboom will read the isiXhosa news bulletin on the SABC for the last time tonight after 37 years. She has given incisive isiXhosa commentary on such events as the burial of South Africa’s struggle heroes like Chris Hani and Oliver Tambo.
	
	Ms Dlulane added that when a person has distinguished herself in the manner and proportion that Noxolo has, it is difficult to find congratulatory words. “The committee wishes her a restful retirement. Simthanda sonk’ emakhaya.”
