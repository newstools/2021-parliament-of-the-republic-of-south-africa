Parliament, Friday, 5 March 2021 – The Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Police, Ms Tina Joemat-Pettersson, has learned with dismay of allegations of religious discrimination after a Muslim woman claimed her gun licence application was denied on the basis that she wore a head scarf in her application photo.
	
	“If true, this allegation is a direct affront to the democratic values of human dignity and freedom contained in the the Bill of Rights. Furthermore, if true, the allegation undermines the right to equality which is clear that ‘the state may not unfairly discriminate directly or indirectly against anyone on one or more grounds, including race, gender, sex, pregnancy, marital status, ethnic or social origin, colour, sexual orientation, age, disability, religion, conscience, belief, culture, language and birth’,” Ms Joemat-Pettersson emphasised.
	
	As a result, the Portfolio Committee on Police has urgently written to the Senior Management of SAPS (South African Police Service) to provide a report with reasons that led to the refusal of the licence. The committee will subsequent to the receipt of the report, consider and formulate a view on the matter.
	
	But the principle remains that no one should be discriminated against directly or indirectly on the basis of religion. “If the allegation is proven to be correct, then serious consequence management must be implemented,” said Ms Joemat-Pettersson.
