Parliament, Saturday, 13 March 2021 – The Portfolio Committee on Sports, Arts and Culture is shocked to learn of the passing of prominent, premier and veteran actors, Ms Noxolo Noxy Maqashalala and Mr Menzi Ngubane who both passed on today.
	
	The Chairperson of the committee, Ms Beauty Dlulane, said South Africa has lost actors whose exploits came to define television in the late 1990s and 2000. She said the committee sends its deepest condolences to Maqashalala and Ngubane families, relatives and friends, arts community, and all South Africans.
	
	According to media reports, Noxy was found dead in her Johannesburg home, and Menzi who suffered a long kidney illness succumbed to a stroke. “It will be hard to find one person who did not derive enjoyment from talents of these veterans, who were so distinct in style and so commanding as characters. South Africa has lost,” said Ms Dlulane.
	
	Ms Dlualne added: “Despite this loss we should be happy this two showcased television acting for all up and coming artists. Television will surely be poorer without them.”
