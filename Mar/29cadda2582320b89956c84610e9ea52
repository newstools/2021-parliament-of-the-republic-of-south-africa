Parliament, Wednesday, 17 March 2021 – The Portfolio Committee on Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) has told the leaders and managers of the Frances Baard District Municipality District Municipality and the municipalities under its jurisdiction that it is encouraged to note that Dikgatlong Local and Frances Baard District municipalities finally progressed from stagnant audit outcomes in the 2019/20 financial report.
	
	Dikgatlong Local Municipality was stuck in a disclaimer audit opinion for the 2017/18 and 2018/19 financial years, but progressed to a qualified audit in 2019/20. Although the committee notes with appreciation this great improvement, it told the municipalities that this still falls short of the accounting excellence that the communities they serve demand.
	
	“I am also happy to note that the district, which had also stagnated on an unqualified audit opinion with matters of emphasis in 2016/17, 2017/18 and 2018/19, finally progressed to a clean audit in 2019/20. This is a commendable feat, considering that the majority of senior management positions in the municipality are vacant,” said the Chairperson of the committee, Ms Faith Muthambi.
	
	The committee had an engagement yesterday with Frances Baard District Municipality and all the municipalities under its jurisdiction, which include Sol Plaatjie, Phokwane, Magareng, Dikgatlong local municipalities. The committee also received a briefing from the Office of the Auditor-General and provincial Departments of Cooperative Governance, Human Settlements and Traditional Affairs, as well as Treasury.
	
	The committee heard that Magareng Local Muncipality has regressed from qualified audit opinions in 2015/16, 2016/17, 2017/18 and 2018/19, to a disclaimer in 2019/20. Ms Muthambi said: “We are informed that the municipality had not spent any of its 2020/21 MIG allocation as at January 2021 due to a dispute with Sanral. The municipality is therefore unlikely to utilise much of this grant come end of June 2021. This does not bode well for service delivery to the communities of Magareng.”
	
	The committee reminded the leadership of Phokwane Local Municipality that it last interacted with the municipality’s administrator on 20 August 2020, two months before the election of the new council in November 2020. The administrator assured the committee that he was on track in moving the municipality from a disclaimed zone to an unqualified audit.
	
	However, the administrator has not fulfilled his promise, as the presentation from the Provincial Treasury indicates that the municipality has regressed from a qualified opinion in 2017/18 and 2018/19 to a disclaimed opinion in 2019/20. “Presenting unrealistic commitments and failing to honour them is not acceptable to this committee. We are noting and following up on all commitments presented to this committee,” emphasised Ms Muthambi.
	
	ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON COOPERATIVE GOVERNANCE AND TRADITIONAL AFFAIRS, MS FAITH MUTHAMBI.
