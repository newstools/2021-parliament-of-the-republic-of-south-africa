Parliament, Wednesday 06 January 2021 - The Presiding Officers, led by National Assembly Speaker Ms Thandi Modise and National Council of Provinces Chairperson Mr Amos Masondo, have learnt with sadness about the passing on of former Member of Parliament (MP) and Defence Deputy Minister Mluleki George.
	
	Mr George, 72, was an MP from 1994 to 2014 where he served in various committees, including chairing the Portfolio Committee on Safety and Security. He also served as Deputy Minister of Defence in the third administration.
	
	A fierce anti-apartheid struggle activist, Mr George was amongst those who established the United Democratic Front (UDF), the National Sports Council and also served in numerous sports structures such as rugby and soccer.
	
	Said the Presiding Officers: "The story of the evolution of the democratic Parliament would be incomplete without the role the first generation of legislators such as Mr Mluleki George played. His generation did not only put in place strong systems of accountability, law-making and public involvement based on the values in the democratic Constitution of transparency, openness and accountability but also in the transformation of the national Legislature from one of the symbols of colonial and apartheid oppression to a truly democratic institution and the quintessence of the will of the people."
	
	The Presiding Officers pay tribute to this departed compatriot, who has without a doubt left an indelible mark of selfless, dedicated and passionate service to the nation through diverse roles.
	
	The Presiding Officers have also extended their heartfelt condolences and sympathies to his family, friends and comrades.
