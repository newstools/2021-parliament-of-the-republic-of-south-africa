Parliament, Friday, 15 January 2021 – The Portfolio Committee on Sports, Arts and Culture is saddened by the passing of two stalwarts in the Arts and Culture sector, Dr Welcome “Bhodloza” Nzimande and Dr Bongumenzi Mpungose.
	
	Dr Nzimande was a veteran broadcaster who dedicated all his life in promoting Maskandi, and African music in general. Dr Mpungose was the Chief Executive Officer of the Pan South African Language Board (PanSALB).
	
	The Chairperson of the committee, Ms Beauty Dlulane, said there can never be enough words to describe this loss to the sector. “The committee sends it deepest condolences to the families and friends of these gentleman. The arts sector is poorer for their passing. It will be hard not to see or hear about the contributions these giants have made using culture.
	
	“Perhaps a fitting tribute will be to carry forward their vision, and never undermine the empowering role our cultures play.”
