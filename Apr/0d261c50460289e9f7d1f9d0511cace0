Parliament, Wednesday, 7 April 2021 – The Chairperson of the Select Committee on Health and Social Services, Ms Maurencia Gillion, said the theme for World Health Day has indeed shown the importance of accessing good-quality healthcare.
	
	This year’s theme by the World Health Organization (WHO) for World Health Day 2021 is “Building a fairer, healthier world”, which indicates and states that the world is unequal.
	
	Ms Gillion said the Covid-19 pandemic has clearly shown stark differences in that those from disadvantaged communities are less likely to have access to good healthcare services.
	
	Ms Gillion said the pandemic has brought a painful reminder to us all South Africans that we need healthcare reforms to ensure access to universal healthcare coverage, so that everyone is able to access good-quality healthcare services so that no one is left behind because of their financial situation.
