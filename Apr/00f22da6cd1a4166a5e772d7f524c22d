Parliament, Sunday 11 April 2021 – The Presiding Officers of Parliament, led by Speaker Thandi Modise of the National Assembly (NA) and Chairperson Amos Masondo of the National Council of Provinces (NCOP), have expressed their satisfaction with work done in the first quarter of 2021 as “setting a good foundation for accelerated delivery of Parliamentary services to the people of South Africa this year”.
	
	A report outlining Parliament’s work during the 1st quarter of 2021, demonstrates a very hectic programme, which epitomised Parliament’s resilience in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, in delivering on its three-legged mandate of law-making, executive oversight and promotion of public participation and involvement. The overview report covers:
	
	 Law-making Strengthening of executive oversight Enhancing public participation Sharpening the capacity of the legislature The Presiding Officers said: “The resilience of Parliament, its leadership, Members of Parliament and employees, triggered by the outbreak of Covid-19 and the national lockdown in 2020, continues to grow in 2021. The spirit that drove Parliament to hold its first virtual meeting of the Portfolio Committee on Health on 10 April 2020, continued to permeate every facet of its being, as we appreciate the amount of work done in just over 60 days from 26 January to the time it went on recess in March 2021. We do not doubt that when we resume with our work on 3 May 2021, we would take from where we left off.”
