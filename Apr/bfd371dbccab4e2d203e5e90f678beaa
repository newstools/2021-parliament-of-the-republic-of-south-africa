Parliament, Wednesday, 14 April 2021 – The Presiding Officers of Parliament, led by the Speaker of the National Assembly Ms Thandi Modise and the Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces Mr Amos Masondo, extend well wishes to the Muslim community for a blessed holy month of Ramadan.
	
	The holy month is characterised by fasting, prayer, giving to charity and reaching out to the poor and vulnerable. The Presiding Officers said they trust that the Muslim community would use this consecrated period to introspect, reflect, worship and pray for themselves and for South Africa to emerge stronger in pushing back all the socio-economic challenges.
	
	“May the month of Ramadan be peaceful, bring joy and reignite hope. May the Islamic principles of compassion, generosity, selflessness and the valuable lessons of this period permeate to all as we accelerate our collective fight against Covid-19 pandemic for good health and greater quality of life for all South Africans”, said the Presiding Officers.
	
	Ramadan Mubarak.
