Parliament, Friday, 14 May 2021 – The Portfolio Committee on Trade and Industry has adopted its report on the President’s reservations about the Copyright and the Performers’ Protection Amendment Bills.
	
	The Chairperson of the committee, Mr Duma Nkosi, said that there was broad consensus with respect to all reservations. This report must be considered by the National Assembly (NA).
	
	If adopted, the committee will proceed to address the reservations. The committee has proposed that it should seek further public participation by calling for public comment on the clauses pertaining to fair use and other copyright exemptions, as well as whether the Bills align with the relevant international obligations.
	
	However, Mr Nkosi emphasised that these comments are limited to the scope of the reservations, as per the joint rules of Parliament. Any matters outside this scope cannot be considered by the Portfolio Committee on Trade and Industry.
	
	Once the NA adopts the report, the committee will begin its public participation process by publishing its advertisement on Parliament’s website and social media platforms, as well as in newspapers.
	
	ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON TRADE AND INDUSTRY, MR DUMA NKOSI.
