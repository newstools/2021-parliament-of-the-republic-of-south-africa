Parliament, Friday, 14 May 2021 – The Portfolio Committee on Communications will on Tuesday, 25 May 2021, hold a virtual roundtable discussion on the impact of digital media in misinformation and content moderation in line with its February 2021 resolution. It resolved, among other things, to look closely at the role of communication on elections.
	
	In the first engagement on the matter, the committee was briefed by Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa), South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC), Media Development and Diversity Agency (MDDA), and the National Community Radio Forum on their state of readiness to cover the 2021 local government elections.
	
	Taking into account the proliferation of online platforms, and for the purposes of free and fair elections, the committee has invited Facebook, Twitter and Google SA to moderate discussions. The committee is pleased that so far Facebook has confirmed, and it is looking forward to others doing the same.
	
	Participants will include, among others, the Department of Communications and Digital Technologies together with entities reporting to the department, Wits Link Centre, Media Monitoring Africa, and the Independent Electoral Commission.
	
	The discussion will take place from 09:00 to 13:00.
	
	ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON COMMUNICATIONS, MR BOYCE MANELI.
