Parliament, Tuesday, 25 May 2021 – The Portfolio Committee on Home Affairs will tomorrow, Wednesday 26 May 2021, undertake an oversight visit to the Government Printing Works (GPW) head office. The visit follows a resolution the committee made on 11 May 2020 that the GPW’s strategic position and its growth potential in the rest of Africa warrants strengthening through effective oversight.
	
	Also, various allegations made about the GPW prompt the committee to devote urgent attention to it, with the aim of protecting and promoting its work.
	
	The committee intends to interact with stakeholders, including senior management, labour unions and the Department of Home Affairs to find solutions to reported allegations and challenges at the GPW, including the alleged loss of data and system crash that hampered production.
	
	“The committee remains of the view that the GPW plays an integral part in producing credible security documentation in South Africa and it has made impressive strides in extending its footprint into the SADC [Southern African Development Community] region, with the ultimate goal of serving the entire African continent, and its stability and efficient functioning must be protected at all times,” said Mr Mosa Chabane, the Acting Chairperson.
	
	Details of the visit:
	Date: Wednesday, 26 May 2021
	Venue: GPW Offices, 83 Visagie Street. Pretoria
