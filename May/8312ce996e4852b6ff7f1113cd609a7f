Parliament, Friday, 21 May 2021 – The Standing Committee on the Auditor-General (SCOAG) appreciates the briefing it received from the Auditor-General (AG) on the process of appointing a Deputy Auditor-General (DAG).
	
	The AG asked the committee to support the recommendation of the appointment of Mr Vonani Chauke as the DAG. The committee appreciates the consultation by the AG and the satisfactory responses she provided to the committee on this matter.
