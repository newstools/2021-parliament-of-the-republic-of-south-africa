Parliament, Tuesday, 11 May 2021 – The Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) today received a briefing from the Department of Public Works and Infrastructure on the implementation of the recommendations made by Scopa following its visit to the Beitbridge border fence.
	
	Scopa is not pleased with the slow pace of investigations and consequence management as far is this matter is concerned. The committee will request a report from the law enforcement agencies on progress regarding this matter. The committee will also request a report from National Treasury on the request sent to it by the department to blacklist and monitor the principal agent and contractor from doing business with the government.
	
	The committee will also request the State Security Agency (SSA) to provide a report on the vetting of the department’s supply chain management officials. Scopa has been informed that the department has vetted a total of 230 supply chain management officials and will seek assistance from SSA to fast-track the process of the vetting of the remaining officials.
	
	The committee has also been informed by the Minister of Public Works and Infrastructure that the department has taken a decision not to undertake any repairs on the fence in its current form as that will consititute fruitless and wastefull expenditure. The department is looking at a long-term solution for all the border fences.
	
	ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF SCOPA, MR MKHULEKO HLENGWA.
