Parliament, Monday, 24 May 2021 – The Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Mineral Resources and Energy, Mr Sahlulele Luzipo, has learned with shock and dismay of the reported brutal murder of the General Manager of Richards Bay Minerals, Mr Nico Swart, as widely reported in media. Mr Luzipo extends heartfelt condolences to Mr Swart’s family, friends and colleagues.
	
	Mr Luzipo condemned this horrific crime and understands that the police are investigating a case of murder. He called on all law enforcement agencies to be relentless in their investigation, until those involved are arrested and a motive established.
	
	Luzipo said incidences of this nature warrant a long-term jail sentence in order to send a strong message that crime is not tolerated in South African society. “A crime of this nature not only robs the country of good men and women, but also threatens much-needed direct foreign investment in the economy,” said Mr Luzipo.
	
	In sending his condolences to Mr Swart’s family, friends and colleagues, Mr Luzipo said: “May his soul rest in peace.”
