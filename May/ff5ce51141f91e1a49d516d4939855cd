Parliament, Friday, 14 May 2021 – The Ad Hoc Committee to initiate and Introduce Legislation amending Section 25 of the Constitution today met to begin deliberations on the Draft Constitution Eighteenth Amendment Bill. The bill seeks to enable amendments to the Constitution to make it possible for the state to expropriate land without compensation. Committee Chairperson Dr Mathole Motshekga explained that the envisaged amendment to the Constitution to allow for expropriation of land without compensation must not be seen as a black and white people issue, but a South African issue. “We have been tasked to find solutions to the historical problem that we have. It is not about the EFF or ANC. The outcome of this process must meet the aspirations of South Africans as a whole,” he said. The committee will continue deliberating on the bill clause by clause and aims to conclude the deliberations before the end of May deadline.
