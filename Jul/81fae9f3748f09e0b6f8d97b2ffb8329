	Parliament, Sunday 11 July 2021 – The Presiding Officers of Parliament have observed, with great concern, the acts of violence and criminality in KwaZulu-Natal and call for calm and adherence to the rule of law.
	
	The right to peaceful protests is one of the rights in our Constitution, whose 25th anniversary we are marking this year. However, violence, criminality and incitement are an affront to our constitutional democracy. Patriotic South Africans, who cherish our freedoms, must frown upon such acts and do everything to discourage them. This includes treating social media information with caution and not spreading fake information or information aimed at inciting violent or illegal activity.
	
	These acts are not representative of the broad sentiments of the citizens of KwaZulu-Natal or South Africans in general. We trust that they will be brought to an end swiftly.
	
	Said the Presiding Officers: "Such acts, including the torching of trucks, malicious damage to property and interfering with freedom of movement threaten the right to life, peace and livelihoods at a time when the nation is also suffering hardships because of the COVID 19 pandemic."
	
	The Presiding Officers are sympathetic to the personal difficulties confronting former President Jacob Zuma. However, the rule of law and supremacy of the Constitution must prevail and be observed by all.
