Parliament, Monday, 12 July 2021 – The Joint Standing Committee on Defence will on Wednesday, 14 July 2021, urgently convene a meeting with the Minister of Defence and Military Veterans, together with senior management of the South African National Defence (SANDF) to receive a briefing on the security situation in the country and related matters.
	
	“The committee has considered it urgent to interact with the Minister and the top brass of the military to receive a briefing on the internal security situation following the outbreak of unrest, vandalism of property and brazen looting of shops in both KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng. The committee is calling for calm and restoration of law and order. The committee is worried about the impact of these incidents on the economy and jobs especially considering that our economy was just starting to recover from the debilitating effects of the pandemic,” said Mr Cyril Xaba, the Co-Chairperson of the Committee.
	
	The committee supports the deployment of soldiers to work in support of the police which are overwhelmed and spread out too thinly. “We thus would want to ascertain the role of the SANDF in establishing and maintenance of compliance to the rule of law in the two provinces,” said Mr Elleck Nchabeleng, the Co-Chairperson of the committee.
	
	Details of the meeting are as follows: 
	DATE: Wednesday, 14 July 2021
	TIME: 18:00
	VENUE: Virtual platform
	
	ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CO-CHAIRPERSONS OF THE JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON DEFENCE, MR CYRIL XABA AND MR MAMAGASE NCHABELENG
