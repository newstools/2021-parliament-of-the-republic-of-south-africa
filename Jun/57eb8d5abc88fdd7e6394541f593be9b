Parliament, Friday, 11 June 2021 – The Portfolio Committee on Higher Education, Science and Technology welcomes the sentencing of Aubrey Manaka, the man who was found guilty of killing Precious Ramabulana, the student who was studying at Capricorn TVET college.
	
	The committee welcomes the sentencing after Aubrey Manaka confessed to the gruesome murder and rape of Precious Ramabulana, including revelations that he stabbed her 90 times. The committee is pleased that the wheels of justice have led to the conviction and sentencing of Manaka to a life sentence for rape, 15 years for robbery with aggravating circumstances, and eight years for housebreaking with intent to commit a crime.
	
	As in this case, students living on campus and in off-campus accommodation are vulnerable to gender-based violence and femicide (GBVF), which is rife in South Africa. Such sentences for perpetrators are an encouragement in the fight against GBVF. The committee believes that there is a need to investigate security at off-campus student accommodation. It is crucial that all measures are taken to prevent GBVF at all student accommodation.
	
	The committee sends its heartfelt sympathy to the family of Precious Ramabulana and hopes that this sentencing brings some comfort and closure to the family. Justice has been meted out.
	
	ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON HIGHER EDUCATION, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, MR PHILLY MAPULANE.
