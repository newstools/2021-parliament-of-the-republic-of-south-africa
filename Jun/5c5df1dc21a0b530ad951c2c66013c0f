Parliament, Saturday, 26 June 2021 – The Sub-Committee of the Portfolio Committee on Women, Youth and Persons with Disabilities, and the Select Committee on Health and Social Services on the filling of vacancies for the National Youth Development Agency (NYDA) concluded interviews for the NYDA Board. The term of the previous Board expired in May 2020 which led to seven vacancies. Last month, the Sub-Committee met and shortlisted 40 candidates who reflect the demographics and geographical spread of the Republic. Subsequently, the candidates were interviewed from 22 to 25 June.
	
	The filling of the vacancies is done in accordance with the NYDA Act 54 of 2008. The Act stipulates that the youth must participate in the nomination of candidates; the process of appointment must be transparent and open; and the names of the shortlisted candidates must be published.
	
	The Sub-Committee will meet next week on 1 and 2 July to deliberate and recommend the candidates to be appointed to the Board.
	
	ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSONS OF THE SUB-COMMITTEE OF THE PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON WOMEN, YOUTH AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES, MS NONHLANHLA NCUBE-NDABA, AND THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES, MS MAURENCIA GILLION.
