Parliament, Wednesday, 16 June 2021 – The Portfolio Committee on Social Development has taken a decision to postpone the public hearings into the Children Amendment Bill.
	
	“In light of the announcement made by the President to move the country to lockdown level 3, the committee took the decision to postpone the public hearings until further notice,” said the Chairperson of the committee, Mr Mondli Gungubele.
	
	Mr Gungubele said this was an important step in the context of President Cyril Ramaphos’s pronouncements on Tuesday night.
	
	“The committee is always mindful of the Covid-19 spontaneous outbreak, the numbers are reportedly increasing at an alarming rate and the committee cannot afford to expose our people to the dangers of Covid-19,” Mr Gungubele continued.
	
	He said public hearings by nature, as evidenced in Limpopo and Mpumalanga, mean huge turnout of people in a confined space. “As much as the committee complies with all Covid-19 protocols and prevention measures, one cannot guarantee 100% safety,” emphasised Mr Gungubele.
	
	The Children’s Amendment Bill is intended to improve the services for children and ensure that their welfare is adequately taken care of.
	
	The public hearings were scheduled to take place in the North West, KwaZulu-Natal, and the Eastern Cape in the next four weeks.
	
	ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY SERVICES ON BEHALAF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT, MR MONDLI GUNGUBELE.
