Parliament, Monday, 7 June 2021 – The Portfolio Committee on Sports, Arts and Culture has learnt with shock the passing of veteran actor, Ms Shaleen Surtie-Richards. The committee sends its condolences to the family of the deceased, relatives, and the arts and culture community. The Chairperson of the committee, Ms Beauty Dlulane, said: “The departure of ‘Tanie’ is a massive blow that has happened at a wrong time. This legend has offered so much through her acting career over the years, and expected so less.” Ms Dlulane added that her passing is a reminder that the sector will never be the same, so many of our legends have departed. “She was a queen of stage, and once more our country has lost. May her soul rest in eternal peace.” Ms Dlulane said. The decorated Ms Surtie-Richards passed on Monday and played Nenna in Egoli and immortalized so many roles she was tasked with acting.
