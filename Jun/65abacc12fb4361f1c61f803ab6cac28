Parliament, Wednesday, 23 June 2021 – The Portfolio Committee on Public Service and Administration (PSA) today received a briefing on submissions for the Ease of Doing Business Bill. This is a private Member’s Bill brought before the committee by Member of Parliament, Mr Henro Kruger, which seeks to reduce the red tape for small business and establish a unit in the Presidency to look after small business.
	
	The committee heard five presentations from the Small Business Insitute, South African Small and Medium Enterprises Association, Sakeliga, Free Market Foundation and the Exporters Club of Cape Town.
	
	The Committee enquired on the rationale of the Bill as the objects are similar with the Red Tape Impact Assessment Bill which was rejected by the sister Committee on Small Business and Development. The Bill further propose a newly established unit within Presidency and the restructuring of the department to accommodate the view of the presenters as well as the role of the Office of the Deputy President which was not mentioned in all the presentations.
	
	The Chairperson of the committee, Mr Tyotyo James, adjourned the meeting with the assurance that members of the committee after having heard the presentations will reflect and a follow-up meeting will be held to discuss the way forward.
	
	ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC SERVICE AND ADMINISTRATION, MR TYOTYO JAMES.
