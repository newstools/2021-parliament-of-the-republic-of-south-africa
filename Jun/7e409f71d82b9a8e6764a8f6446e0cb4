Parliament, Friday, 18 June 2021 – The Ad Hoc Committee on Legislation Amending Section 25 of the Constitution today continued with deliberations on the Draft Constitution Eighteenth Amendment Bill. The Bill seeks to enable amendments to the Constitution to make it possible for the state to expropriate land without compensation. So far, there has not been clear agreement on the Bill among parties represented in the committee, especially where it refers to nil compensation, state custodianship of the land, and also on the actual need to amend the Constitution itself. The parties have agreed to submit revised versions of their submissions and to continue discussions in the next meeting. Committee Chairperson, Dr Mathole Motshekga, warned that failure by Parliament and the committee to find solutions to the land question in South Africa could lead to the Zimbabwe situation. “If law-makers are not able to resolve the land question, the people will take the law into their own hands, and that will be a sad day,” said Dr Motshekga.
