Parliament, Tuesday, 1 June 2021 – The Portfolio Committee on Sports, Arts and Culture has noted with sadness the passing of the legendary actor, Mr Macdonald Mathunjwa, on Tuesday.
	
	The Chairperson of the committee, Ms Beauty Dlulane, said the loss of Mr Mathunjwa leaves the South African television (TV) industry poorer. “Macdonald was one funny character, who without uttering a word, people would be tempted to lough. He was so recognisable that the news of his passing, a mere month after the passing of another television legend, Menzi Ngubane, is another big blow South Africans will take long to recover from,” said Ms Dlulane.
	
	His career spanned various popular TV shows and, according to Ms Dlulane, whether he played a menial character, he made sure of turning that into prominence and relatable to viewership.
	
	The committee sends its deepest condolences to the family, relatives and those who he was unrelenting to entertain.
