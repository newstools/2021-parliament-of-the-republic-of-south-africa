Parliament, Saturday, 05 June 2021 – The Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Mineral Resources and Energy, Mr Sahlulele Luzipo, has congratulated Minister Gwede Mantashe on his attainment of the Masters of Business Administration (MBA) from MANCOSA.
	
	He was conferred with an MBA during a virtual graduation ceremony on Saturday, 5 June 2021. Mr Luzipo understands that Minister Mantashe obtained his first Master’s Degree in 2008 from Wits University, and that he holds a Bachelor of Commerce Honours in Economics from the University of South Africa.
	
	These achievements, according to Mr Luzipo, should serve as inspiration to public servants and young people in particular.
	
	Mr Luzipo said: “Mr Mantashe has put into practice the old Xhosa adage, ‘imfundo ayikhulelwa,’ loosely translated ‘you are never too old to learn’.”
	
	Mr Luzipo believes that the academic and on-the-job knowledge Minister Mantashe has gained throughout the years will add value not only to him as an individual, but also to other sectors where he is involved.
	
	“Once again, we congratulate the Minister for this momentous achievement,” said Mr Luzipo.
	
	ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON MINERAL RESOURCES AND ENERGY, MR SAHLULELE LUZIPO.
