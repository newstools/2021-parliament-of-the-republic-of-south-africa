Parliament, Friday, 18 June 2021 – The National Council of Provinces (NCOP) at its virtual plenary sitting today has passed the 2021 Appropriation Bill without any amendment.
	
	The Bill is intended to allocate money from the National Revenue Fund for requirements of the State for the 2021/22 financial year as required by Section 213 of the Constitution and section 26 of the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA).
	
	The National Assembly adopted the bill on the 4th of June and was sent to the NCOP for consideration and concurrence. The passing of the 2021 Appropriation Bill followed the debate on the Bill and the consideration of the Report of the Select Committee on Appropriations.
	
	At the same sitting, the Special Appropriation Bill [B5-2021) was also passed. Section 16 (1) of the (PFMA) authorises the Finance Minister to request Parliament to allocate funds from the National Revenue to cover the expenditure of an exceptional nature which is currently not provided for and which cannot, without serious prejudice to the public interest, be postponed to a future parliamentary appropriation of funds. The COVID-19 pandemic and the worsening economic conditions confronting the country made this special Appropriation necessary.
	
	The Bill will now be sent to the President for assent as required by the Constitution.
