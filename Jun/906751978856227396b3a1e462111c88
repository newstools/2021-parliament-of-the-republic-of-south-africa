Parliament, Tuesday, 1 June 2021 – The Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) today received a briefing from the Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA) on the allegations of corruption, fraud and maladministration that were brought to Scopa by the President of the United Democratic Movement (UDM), Mr Bantu Holomisa.
	
	Scopa has noted the remarks made by the Miister of Finance, who is the executive authority responsible for the DBSA. The committee has also noted the responses and explainations provided by the DBSA on this matter. The responses and explanations from the DBSA did not assist the committee with the information it required. The committee is satisfied with the fact that it provided both parties to state their cases.
	
	Scopa will now start the process of instituting an inquiry into the DBSA. The committee will consult Parliament Legal Services on the process to follow as it begins this process. During the inquiry, the submission made by Mr Holomisa will be considered, as well as the submission made today by the DBSA. The committee will also work with the office of the Auditor-General and the Special Investigating Unit in this matter.
	
	ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF SCOPA, MR MKHULEKO HLENGWA.
