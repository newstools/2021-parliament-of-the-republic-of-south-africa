Parliament, Wednesday 9 June 2021 - The Deputy Chairperson of the NCOP, Ms Sylvia Lucas, has learnt with shock and sadness the passing of veteran South African actress Ms Shaleen Surtie-Richards.
	
	Ms Surtie-Richards, affectionately known as “Tannie”, was born on 7 May 1955 in Upington. Tannie started her career as a teacher and spent years at Oranje Oewer Primary School in Upington, where Ms Lucas was also a learner. She later ventured into acting.
	
	“It is with a deep sense of loss to hear about the passing of a humble and seasoned actress who touched ordinary people’s lives through her artistic talent. The various roles she played on stage united South Africans in diversity”, Said Deputy Chairperson Ms Lucas.
	
	“Her passing on has left South Africa poorer and deprived many young artists a chance to learn a lot from her. May her humble soul rest in peace”, she added.
	
	Deputy Chairperson of the NCOP sends her heartfelt condolences to her family, friend and colleagues.
