Parliament, Friday, 25 February 2021 – The Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Sports, Arts and Culture, Ms Beauty Dlulane, has voiced her support of Mr Patrice Motsepe’s candidacy for President of the Confederation of African Football (CAF).
	
	Ms Dlulane said the candidacy is exciting, particularly given African football’s potential, which has remained in the shadows for longer than it should have. “The support for this candidacy is not so much about being South African, but rather Mr Motsepe’s vision and capability.”
	
	On Thursday, Mr Motsepe revealed his 10-point manifesto for the CAF presidency. He is currently the owner of Mamelodi Sundowns and has demonstrated strong leadership during his long involvement in football administration. He is also a successful businessman, with strong international connections and a proud African. This will stand him in good stead at CAF, Ms Dlulane said.
	
	His presidency will also make Africa more competitive at global events. “It’s about time African football is administered by people who have the best interests of athletes at heart. Regionalism has suffocated African football longer than time,” she added.
