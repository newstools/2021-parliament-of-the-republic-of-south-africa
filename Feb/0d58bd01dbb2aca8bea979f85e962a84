Parliament, Monday 1 February 2021 – Parliament’s Presiding Officers, led by National Assembly Speaker Ms Thandi Modise and National Council of Provinces Chairperson Mr Amos Masondo, convey heartfelt condolences to family, friends and organisations of Ms Rebecca Kotane, who passed away on Sunday, 31 January 2021.
	
	Mme Kotane was the widow of South African Communist Party leader Mr Moses Kotane.
	
	“Mme Kotane comes from a selfless and brave generation of women who were at the forefront of bringing about a democratic, non-racial and free South Africa. She was for many years a thorn in the side of the brutal apartheid system, and boldly confronted its rulers - including taking the battle to their doorstep during the historic 1956 Women’s March to the Union Buildings. It is fearless women like Mme Kotane who rejected the status quo and inspired generations of freedom fighters, who made the democracy we enjoy today possible."
	
	“We continue to be inspired by the unwavering and bold resolve of Mme Kotane, and we will not rest until all forms of injustice, particularly against women and girl-children, are eliminated. We pledge to honour her contribution to our struggle for a better life for all by continuing to strengthen and deepen our democracy and all its instruments”, added the Presiding Officers.
	
	Parliament sends its warmest and heartfelt condolences to the Kotane family, relatives, friends and comrades.
