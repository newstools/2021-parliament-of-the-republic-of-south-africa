Parliament, Monday, 1 February 2021 – The Portfolio Committee on Trade and Industry has learnt with great sadness of the passing of one of its longest serving members, Ms Priscilla Tozama Mantashe.
	
	Committee Chairperson, Mr Duma Nkosi, said Ms Mantashe has succumbed to complications due to Covid-19 after being in hospital for several weeks. “She was a diligent member of our committee that always provided valuable inputs. She had great institutional memory as she served on the committee during the previous Parliament as well.
	
	“Issues of women empowerment, broad-based black economic empowerment and the upliftment of rural communities were close to her heart and this was clear from her line of questions during our meetings with the department and its entities. We are truly saddened to have lost such a great fighter for the poor and vulnerable communities.”
	
	Mr Nkosi said: “On behalf of the committee, I want to send our condolences to her family, friends and colleagues. We further wish to thank her family for the sacrifice they made in allowing her to serve our nation.”
	
	ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON TRADE AND INDUSTRY, MR DUMA NKOSI.
