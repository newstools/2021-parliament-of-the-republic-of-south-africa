Parliament, Saturday, 13 February 2021 – The Portfolio Committee on Sports, Arts and Culture has learnt with shock the passing of East London’s famous son and boxing promoter, Mr Mzimasi Mnguni.
	
	The Chairperson of the committee, Ms Beauty Dlulane, characterised Mr Mnguni’s departure as, in boxing language, a below the belt punch, boxing fraternity will have to endure.
	
	“Bra Mzi is an undisputed father of the South African boxing. He not only single-handedly churned champions, but played a father figure to many of the boxers he managed. This is a loss the South African boxing did not want,” added Ms Dlulane.
	
	Bra Mzi passed away today after a long illness that saw him wheelchair bound. His ill-health has led to the decline of boxing in South Africa, especially in East London, his home town.
	
	The committee sends its heartfelt condolences to the family, relatives and boxing fraternity. Ms Dlulane said the committee speaks on behalf of every South African when it says a legend has departed.
	
	“We say to Bra Mzi, go well champ.”
