Parliament, Monday, 8 February 2021 – The Portfolio Committee on Public Works and Infrastructure has learnt with sadness of the passing of Mr Edwin de Lille, the husband of the Minister of Public Works and Infrastructure, Ms Patricia de Lille.
	
	The Chairperson of the committee, Ms Nolitha Ntobongwana said: “As a committee that works very closely with Minister De Lille, we would like her to know that she is in our thoughts and prayers as she navigates through this painful period. Losing a spouse, who was a constant support system for her, will surely leave a deep vacuum in her life. We hope that she is comforted knowing that we are thinking of her.”
	
	Ms Ntobongwana added: “In this difficult time, may Mr De Lille’s memory remain a constant comfort to the De Lille family. May they find peace and comfort in the beautiful memories they made together as a family and may his soul rest in eternal peace.”
