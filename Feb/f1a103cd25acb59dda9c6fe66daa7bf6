Parliament, Tuesday 23 February 2021 – The National Assembly (NA) during its hybrid plenary sitting this afternoon adopted the Report of the Portfolio Committee on Women, Youth and Persons with Disabilities to restart, from scratch, the process of appointing the National Youth Development Agency (NYDA) Board members.
	
	In September last year, when the initial Committee report was tabled in the National Assembly (NA) the House resolved to send it back to the Portfolio Committee on Women, Youth and Persons with Disabilities for further consideration.
	
	This was after the process to nominate seven candidates for appointment to serve on the NYDA Board came under criticism. Chief amongst the criticisms of the candidates the Committee had recommended for appointment was that the list was not inclusive and representative of the country’s demographics.
	
	In October, the Committee requested further guidance on how to proceed with the matter from the Office of the Speaker of the National Assembly.
	
	Having considered the advice and legal opinion received from the Office of the Speaker, the Committee recommended that the House adopt its resolution to restart, from scratch, the process of appointing the Board members of the NYDA.
	
	Now that the NA has adopted this recommendation the Committee will restart the process as directed.
