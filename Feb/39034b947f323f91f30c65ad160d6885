Parliament, Thursday, 4 February 2021 – The Portfolio Committee on Public Works and Infrastructure has extended the deadline for written submissions on the Expropriation Bill [B23-2020] to Sunday, 28 February 2021.
	
	The committee invites stakeholders and interested persons to submit written submissions on this version of the Expropriation Bill. The purpose of the Bill is to repeal the existing Expropriation Act 63 of 1975. It also seeks to provide a common framework in line with the Constitution to guide the processes and procedures for expropriation of property by organs of state. It also provides for instances where expropriation with nil compensation may be just and equitable. Importantly, the Bill provides for an appeals process for owners of expropriated property, by following uniform, constitutional processes.
