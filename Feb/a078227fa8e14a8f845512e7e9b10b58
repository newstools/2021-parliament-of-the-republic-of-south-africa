Parliament, Wednesday 10 February 2021 – The Portfolio Committee on Women, Youth and Persons with Disabilities, and the Select Committee on Health and Social Services, met yesterday to consider the advice and legal opinion from the Office of the Speaker of the National Assembly (NA) in relation to the appointing of board members for the National Youth Development Agency (NYDA).
	
	After considering the advice and the legal opinion from the Office of the Speaker and the recommendation from the National Assembly Programme Committee (NAPC), the two committees resolved to restart the process of appointment of the NYDA Board members. This is in response to the NAPC instruction that the committees’ resolution has to be adopted by the House for effectiveness.
	
	Since Parliament resolved to refer the matter back to the same sub-committee for reconsideration, the committees agreed to reconvene the sub-committee to discuss the process of the appointment of board members for the NYDA. Members of the committees were of the view that this is an important function that should be done expeditiously.
