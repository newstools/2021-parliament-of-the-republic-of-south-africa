Parliament, Wednesday, 10 February 2021 – The Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) today was briefed by the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) on Covid-19 personal protective equipment-related procurement investigations.
	
	Scopa notes the formal tabling of this report to Parliament following the public release of the report last week. A number of issues emanating from the report require Scopa’s urgent attention and the committee has resolved to prioritise these matters.
	
	Scopa is aware that these are ongoing reports, which the SIU will release periodically as their investigation procedure dictates. This means that the committee will be engaged in a process of following up with the relevant structures to ensure there are speedy prosecutions and other consequence-management processes for those who are implicated.
	
	Scopa will also devise an operating model, which will ensure that the committee prioritises this matter parallel to the committee’s other business.
	
	ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF SCOPA, MR MKHULEKO HLENGWA.
