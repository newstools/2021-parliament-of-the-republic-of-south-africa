Parliament, Thursday, 18 February 2021 – The Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Health, Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo, applauds President Cyril Ramaphosa and the Minister of Health, Dr Zweli Mkhize, for receiving their Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccinations at a public healthcare facility.
	
	Dr Dhlomo said: “When Minister Mkhize briefed Parliament, he mentioned that they are considering that some leaders in government, as well as faith-based and traditional leadership would take up the vaccine first, so that South Africans are encouraged to vaccinate themselves when they see their leaders take the vaccine.”
	
	Dr Dlomo calls on all South Africans to heed the call and take the vaccine. It will ensure our own safety and health, and also the health and safety of those close to us and the people we interact with on a daily basis.
	
	ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON HEALTH, DR SIBONGISENI DHLOMO.
