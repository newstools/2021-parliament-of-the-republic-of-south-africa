Parliament, Thursday, 4 February 2021 – The Portfolio Committee on Social Development has noted the efforts of the Department of Social Development to put an action plan to reinstate lapsed temporary disability grants. On Wednesday, the committee received a follow-up briefing on the work the department is doing on lapsed temporary disability grants, assessments, re-applications and resolving long queues at paypoints.
	
	The Chairperson of the committee, Mr Mondli Gungubele, said the committee appreciated the plan, which is also meant to resolve challenges related to the payment of grants. “The format of reporting can be improved so that it allows the committee to effectively play its oversight role. The committee expects the department to report at its next meeting on how grants payment will be done nationally.”
	
	He said the improved format must also accompany a joint plan for grants payments between the department and the South African Post Office.
	
	The committee heard that 70% of the grants applications have been assessed and are pending finalisation. Mr Gungubele said improved conditions under which people receive their grant payments is what the department should strive for.
	
	ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT, MR MONDLI GUNGUBELE.
